# Pokemon Trading Card Game

This project is a web-based application that provides a platform for Pokemon enthusiasts to register, sign in, and trade Pokemon cards. It's built with PHP. All data for the project is stored in the respective json files.

## Project Description

The Pokemon Trading Card Game project is a platform where users can trade their Pokemon cards with other users. The platform is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, making it easy for users to navigate and perform actions.

Users start by creating an account on the platform. The registration process is simple and requires basic information such as username, email, and password.

Once registered, users can log in to their account where they can view their collection of Pokemon cards, add new cards to their collection, and initiate trades with other users.

If a user is logged in as an admin, they have the ability to add new cards to the platform, delete cards, and view a list of all users and their respective collections.
For a normal user, they can view all the cards available on the platform, trade cards with the admin, and view their own collection of cards.

The platform also includes a search feature, which allows users to search for specific cards based on various criteria such as the card's name, type, or rarity.
